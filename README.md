##FizzBuzz Test##
- As a part of the BootCamp with Factor√≠aF5, Fizz Buzz Test is our first aproach into TDD Tests. In this proyect, we have used Java, IntelliJ and Maven as technologies for this study of tests.
- The idea of this project is to study tests, practice them within a Java environment app and being able to implant tests in a more complex and production context.
